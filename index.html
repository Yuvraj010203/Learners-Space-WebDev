            <p>Clash of Clans is set in a fantasy-themed persistent world where the player is a chief of a village. Clash of Clans tasks players to build their own village using the resources gained from attacking other players' villages with troops, earning rewards, buying them with medals or by producing them at their own village. Players can conjoin to create clans – groups of up to fifty people – who can then participate in Clan Wars together, donate and receive troops, and chat with each other. Players can also build up a Clan village called a Clan Capital.</p>
